//This is swift 3so Swift 4 features will not be supported


//Playgrounds with String assignment
//https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID292 was a very useful resource in doing these

//String Change
var treeType :String
treeType = "Aspen"
treeType = "Oak"

//String Interpolation - usings strings to insert constants, variables, literals, and expressions into longer strings
var treeAge = 10
let message = "The hight of the tree is the age \(treeAge) times 5.9 which is \(Double(treeAge) * 5.9)" //This is not true IRL

//Counting Characters - use the count property of the string

var treeList :String = "Aspen, Oak, Ash, Mapel, Pine, and Palm"
print("the number of characters in \(treeList) is \(treeList.characters.count)")

//Comparing Strings - 3 ways to compare, string and character quality, prefix equality, and suffix equality
//checked with the "equal to" operator ==

var treeQuote = "Thor is the god of Oak Trees"
var sameTreeQuote = "Thor is the god of Oak Trees"
if treeQuote == sameTreeQuote
{
    print("These two strings are consdiered equal")
}







//Changing Var from int to doubles
var age = 2315
var speed = 654.324536
var rate = age/Int (speed)  //is an Int
var ratez = Double (age)/(speed) //changed to a double

//Can use emoji's and symbols in Swift
var ğŸ˜¿ = -34254 //get emojis with "edit --> Emojis and symbols"
print(ğŸ˜¿)
